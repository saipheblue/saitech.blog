Most of the generated \u0026ldquo;translation\u0026rdquo; is based on my own text, wiki entries, or official game descriptions.\nThere’s something both haunting and captivating about wandering through abandoned video game worlds. The concrete jungles, where rusted steel beams entwine crumbling concrete panels like skeletal vines, feel like places you’ve visited in fleeting dreams or glimpsed at the edges of your memory, though you know you never truly have. They exert a peculiar pull, a delicate tension between familiarity and unease.\nI think I’ve finally pinpointed why these spaces fascinate me so deeply. It’s the uncanny valley—not in the usual sense of lifelike robots or hyperrealistic characters, but in how these places mimic the real world while feeling subtly\u0026hellip; wrong. This ties closely to the concept of liminal spaces—those eerie transitional zones frozen in time, evoking an almost otherworldly stillness.\nThese digital landscapes strip away the hum of human presence, leaving behind only echoes. There are no bustling NPCs, no throngs of activity—just you and the hollow, forgotten architecture. Surprisingly, there’s an entire niche in gaming dedicated to this sensation: experiences that aren’t games in the traditional sense, but walking simulators that immerse you in these deserted realms.\nWhat stays with me most are the games that embrace quiet. Horror sometimes leans too heavily on jump scares or dread, but the quieter ones—the ones that simply let you exist—linger in my mind far longer.\nBabbdi Take Babbdi, for example. This short exploration game completely captured my imagination. Its description is simple:\n\u0026ldquo;BABBDI is a short, first-person exploration experience with light narrative and platforming elements. Visit the town of BABBDI, a forsaken district in the outer ring of the megalopolis. Meet its inhabitants and discover how to escape.\u0026rdquo;\nBut this doesn’t tell you what it feels like to play. Wandering through the desolate streets of BABBDI, surrounded by muted gray tones, I found myself immersed in its quiet melancholy. The air felt heavy with stories untold, whispers of lives once lived but now absent. There’s no rush to leave, no immediate threat to overcome—just the haunting beauty of a forgotten place.\nIt’s a game that lingers in your mind long after you’ve played it, much like a dream you can’t quite shake. I’ve promised myself I’ll return to BABBDI one day when I’m in the right mood, just to stroll through its streets again and let its atmosphere wash over me.\nOther \u0026ldquo;Dying Worlds\u0026rdquo; BABBDI is far from the only game that offers this kind of experience. Over time, I’ve stumbled upon others, each with its own take on liminal beauty. Some I’ve played, and some are still waiting for the right moment to pull me in. Here’s a list of games I’m keeping in mind for my next exploration:\nNaissanceE An obscure, magical first-person exploration game that feels like stepping into a giant, mysterious structure. It’s less about solving puzzles and more about letting yourself sink into its timeless, otherworldly atmosphere.\nConcrete Paths A meditative exploration through raw, brutalist architecture. This one feels like walking through forgotten spaces where the world fades to concrete and shadows.\nConcrete Tremor A short, unsettling experience that captures the liminal tension of industrial environments. It’s minimalist but hits hard with its oppressive, empty mood.\nFugue in Void A game that feels more like a visual poem. It takes you through vast, hauntingly empty structures, forcing you to sit with the silence and soak in the mood.\n2:22AM A quiet, contemplative experience about wandering through a neon-lit urban landscape at night. It captures the strange mix of comfort and unease that comes with being awake when the rest of the world is asleep.\nKletka It might not perfectly match the “abandoned” theme, but its atmosphere and mood fit right into the same emotional space. Sometimes, it’s not about the specifics of the environment but the feeling it leaves behind—the echoes, the weight of something unspoken.\nMachinarium Created by Amanita Design,this game isn’t about derelict spaces, yet it captures the same sense of isolation and melancholy. Set in a decaying mechanical world, it immerses you in empty, quiet environments where you feel more like a visitor than a participant. The beauty lies in its silence—the world doesn’t need to be abandoned to feel forgotten. With its delicate atmosphere and Tomas Dvorak’s haunting soundtrack, Machinarium evokes the feeling of wandering through spaces that time has left behind, allowing the stillness to speak for itself.\nSweden - C148 As I get lost in these desolate worlds, there’s one track that always seems to match the feeling perfectly: “Sweden” by C418. Originally from Minecraft.\nIt’s strange and magical how music can emotionally transport you to the same places of abandoned nostalgia.\nManga: Blame! by Tsutomu Nihei Blame! is not a game, but it fits the vibe perfectly. A sprawling, nightmarish city that stretches endlessly, where silence and danger coexist. Nihei’s artwork is all sharp angles and impossible spaces—like a blueprint for the worlds these games explore.\nConclusion These experiences remind me that games don’t always need grand narratives or complex mechanics to make an impact. Sometimes, the simplest thing—a quiet walk through an empty, crumbling world—is all it takes to feel profoundly connected to something beyond words.\nSo next time that strange, reflective mood strikes, I’ll know where to go.

It is part of your Steam library—just download and run it.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;ve previously used your headset on Windows, you might encounter an issue with Steam Link on Linux. It displays the error:\n'Streaming VR is not available from that computer.'\nDue to this limitation, we need to use alternative software to pair with SteamVR.\nSideQuest SideQuest is a popular platform for sideloading apps, games, and experimental software onto standalone VR headsets. It expands the possibilities of your VR device beyond the default app store.\nVisit the official SideQuest site for a detailed guide on how to connect your headset, enable developer mode, and install all prerequisites.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re having trouble connecting your headset, ensure you have ADB (Android Debug Bridge) installed. To check, run:\n1 adb version If it’s not installed, you can get it with:\n1 sudo pacman -S android-tools ALVR (Air Light VR) ALVR allows wireless PC VR gaming by streaming games from your PC to a standalone headset like the Meta Quest series. It uses low-latency video encoding to provide a seamless experience.\nDownload ALVR from the official ALVR GitHub releases page\nInstall the APK on your headset using SideQuest. Extract the .tar file on your Arch Linux machine and run the executable. Follow the on-screen instructions to set up ALVR. Be sure to mark the headset as \u0026ldquo;trusted.\u0026rdquo;\nOnce done, start SteamVR.\nFrom there, manually start VR games from your PC. While this is a limitation, once the game is running, you can enjoy your session in the VR headset.\nTips \u0026amp; tricks Fix for Black Screen on Headset If your VR game runs on your PC but your headset displays a black screen, try this fix: Add the following command to SteamVR\u0026rsquo;s launch options:\n~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/SteamVR/bin/vrmonitor.sh %command%\n(Note: File paths may vary depending on where you installed SteamVR.)\nFix for Games Not Launching in VR Mode Is the game not launching in VR mode? Go to the game properties, then to Compatibility, and enable Proton. After that, in General settings or during the first game launch, it will ask if you want to play in normal mode or VR mode.\nHappy gaming ! :) ","date":"2024-12-30T00:00:00Z","image":"http://localhost:1313/p/quest-3-on-arch/3_hu_974740a45ad8ac36.jpg","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/p/quest-3-on-arch/","title":"Quest 3 on Arch"},{"content":"\nWhat will you need Geiger–Müller kit for example this one Raspberry pi - any model is fine but guide is written for raspberry pi 5.
