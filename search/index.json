Instead, it stopped at a black screen showing the system disk path with a blinking dash underneath.\nI use SDDM as my login manager and BSPWM as my tiling window manager. Naturally, I suspected that the problem was with SDDM since it‚Äôs responsible for the login screen and should be the first thing visible.\nThe Solution Luckily, I could still switch to a TTY by pressing CTRL + ALT + F3. From there, I checked the status of SDDM with:\n1 systemctl status sddm It showed an error: \u0026ldquo;Could not start Display server on vt 2\u0026rdquo; along with other related messages.\nAfter some searching, I found a helpful solution on Reddit in this thread by user omgrolak.\nThe fix is to edit the initramfs configuration and add the necessary GPU modules. In the TTY, run:\n1 sudo nano /etc/mkinitcpio.conf Then add these modules to the MODULES line:\nFor Nvidia: nvidia nvidia_modeset nvidia_uvm nvidia_drm For AMD: amdgpu Save and close the file. Then regenerate the initramfs with:\n1 sudo mkinitcpio -P After this, a reboot fixed the problem, and Arch Linux booted normally again with the login screen showing up properly.\nWhat is intramfs? The initramfs is a temporary, in-memory filesystem that is used by the Linux kernel during startup. Its primary job is to mount the real root filesystem. For this to happen, it needs to have all the necessary modules (drivers) to access the storage hardware and, crucially, to initialize the display.\nFix Breakdown Editing /etc/mkinitcpio.conf: This configuration file controls which modules are built into the initramfs. nvidia: The main driver module. nvidia_modeset: Enables Kernel Mode Setting (KMS), which allows the kernel to control the display resolution and mode directly. This is essential for a smooth graphical boot. nvidia_drm: Provides the Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) interface, which is a modern standard for managing graphics output. nvidia_uvm: The Unified Video Memory module, needed for certain modern NVIDIA features like CUDA. sudo mkinitcpio -P: This command regenerates the initramfs for all kernel presets on your system, applying the changes you made to the configuration file.

Here are some of the key reasons to switch to Vesktop:\n‚úÖ Better Linux Support: Unlike the official Discord app, Vesktop offers improved Linux compatibility and performance. ‚ú® Plugins: Customize your Discord experience with a range of plugins. üé® Custom Themes: Make Discord truly yours with community-made themes from discord-themes.com. üöÄ Fake Nitro: Unlock some premium features (like emojis and stickers) without paying‚Äîthough with certain limitations. Recommended Plugins Here are some of the most useful Vesktop plugins to enhance your experience:\nYoutubeAdblock\nFinally, an adblocker that works inside the Discord app! This was the main reason I migrated to Vesktop. FixYoutubeEmbeds\nBypass Discord\u0026rsquo;s annoying \u0026ldquo;Watch on YouTube\u0026rdquo; restrictions and play videos directly inside the app. WebKeybinds\nAdds missing keybinds to the web version of Discord (which Vesktop uses), making navigation smoother. ClearURLs\nAutomatically removes tracking parameters from URLs for added privacy. CrashHandler\nHandles crashes gracefully without forcing you to restart the entire app. NoDevtoolsWarning\nDisables the \u0026ldquo;HOLD UP\u0026rdquo; warning when opening Developer Tools. It also prevents Discord from hiding your token, helping avoid random logouts‚Äîa must-have for a smoother experience.

Most of the generated \u0026ldquo;translation\u0026rdquo; is based on my own text, wiki entries, or official game descriptions.\nThere‚Äôs something both haunting and captivating about wandering through abandoned video game worlds. The concrete jungles, where rusted steel beams entwine crumbling concrete panels like skeletal vines, feel like places you‚Äôve visited in fleeting dreams or glimpsed at the edges of your memory, though you know you never truly have. They exert a peculiar pull, a delicate tension between familiarity and unease.\nI think I‚Äôve finally pinpointed why these spaces fascinate me so deeply. It‚Äôs the uncanny valley‚Äînot in the usual sense of lifelike robots or hyperrealistic characters, but in how these places mimic the real world while feeling subtly\u0026hellip; wrong. This ties closely to the concept of liminal spaces‚Äîthose eerie transitional zones frozen in time, evoking an almost otherworldly stillness.\nThese digital landscapes strip away the hum of human presence, leaving behind only echoes. There are no bustling NPCs, no throngs of activity‚Äîjust you and the hollow, forgotten architecture. Surprisingly, there‚Äôs an entire niche in gaming dedicated to this sensation: experiences that aren‚Äôt games in the traditional sense, but walking simulators that immerse you in these deserted realms.\nWhat stays with me most are the games that embrace quiet. Horror sometimes leans too heavily on jump scares or dread, but the quieter ones‚Äîthe ones that simply let you exist‚Äîlinger in my mind far longer.\nBabbdi Take Babbdi, for example. This short exploration game completely captured my imagination. Its description is simple:\n\u0026ldquo;BABBDI is a short, first-person exploration experience with light narrative and platforming elements. Visit the town of BABBDI, a forsaken district in the outer ring of the megalopolis. Meet its inhabitants and discover how to escape.\u0026rdquo;\nBut this doesn‚Äôt tell you what it feels like to play. Wandering through the desolate streets of BABBDI, surrounded by muted gray tones, I found myself immersed in its quiet melancholy. The air felt heavy with stories untold, whispers of lives once lived but now absent. There‚Äôs no rush to leave, no immediate threat to overcome‚Äîjust the haunting beauty of a forgotten place.\nIt‚Äôs a game that lingers in your mind long after you‚Äôve played it, much like a dream you can‚Äôt quite shake. I‚Äôve promised myself I‚Äôll return to BABBDI one day when I‚Äôm in the right mood, just to stroll through its streets again and let its atmosphere wash over me.\nOther \u0026ldquo;Dying Worlds\u0026rdquo; BABBDI is far from the only game that offers this kind of experience. Over time, I‚Äôve stumbled upon others, each with its own take on liminal beauty. Some I‚Äôve played, and some are still waiting for the right moment to pull me in. Here‚Äôs a list of games I‚Äôm keeping in mind for my next exploration:\nNaissanceE An obscure, magical first-person exploration game that feels like stepping into a giant, mysterious structure. It‚Äôs less about solving puzzles and more about letting yourself sink into its timeless, otherworldly atmosphere.\nConcrete Paths A meditative exploration through raw, brutalist architecture. This one feels like walking through forgotten spaces where the world fades to concrete and shadows.\nConcrete Tremor A short, unsettling experience that captures the liminal tension of industrial environments. It‚Äôs minimalist but hits hard with its oppressive, empty mood.\nFugue in Void A game that feels more like a visual poem. It takes you through vast, hauntingly empty structures, forcing you to sit with the silence and soak in the mood.\n2:22AM A quiet, contemplative experience about wandering through a neon-lit urban landscape at night. It captures the strange mix of comfort and unease that comes with being awake when the rest of the world is asleep.\nKletka It might not perfectly match the ‚Äúabandoned‚Äù theme, but its atmosphere and mood fit right into the same emotional space. Sometimes, it‚Äôs not about the specifics of the environment but the feeling it leaves behind‚Äîthe echoes, the weight of something unspoken.\nMachinarium Created by Amanita Design,this game isn‚Äôt about derelict spaces, yet it captures the same sense of isolation and melancholy. Set in a decaying mechanical world, it immerses you in empty, quiet environments where you feel more like a visitor than a participant. The beauty lies in its silence‚Äîthe world doesn‚Äôt need to be abandoned to feel forgotten. With its delicate atmosphere and Tomas Dvorak‚Äôs haunting soundtrack, Machinarium evokes the feeling of wandering through spaces that time has left behind, allowing the stillness to speak for itself.\nSweden - C148 As I get lost in these desolate worlds, there‚Äôs one track that always seems to match the feeling perfectly: ‚ÄúSweden‚Äù by C418. Originally from Minecraft.\nIt‚Äôs strange and magical how music can emotionally transport you to the same places of abandoned nostalgia.\nManga: Blame! by Tsutomu Nihei Blame! is not a game, but it fits the vibe perfectly. A sprawling, nightmarish city that stretches endlessly, where silence and danger coexist. Nihei‚Äôs artwork is all sharp angles and impossible spaces‚Äîlike a blueprint for the worlds these games explore.\nConclusion These experiences remind me that games don‚Äôt always need grand narratives or complex mechanics to make an impact. Sometimes, the simplest thing‚Äîa quiet walk through an empty, crumbling world‚Äîis all it takes to feel profoundly connected to something beyond words.\nSo next time that strange, reflective mood strikes, I‚Äôll know where to go.

It is part of your Steam library‚Äîjust download and run it.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;ve previously used your headset on Windows, you might encounter an issue with Steam Link on Linux. It displays the error:\n'Streaming VR is not available from that computer.'\nDue to this limitation, we need to use alternative software to pair with SteamVR.\nSideQuest SideQuest is a popular platform for sideloading apps, games, and experimental software onto standalone VR headsets. It expands the possibilities of your VR device beyond the default app store.\nVisit the official SideQuest site for a detailed guide on how to connect your headset, enable developer mode, and install all prerequisites.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re having trouble connecting your headset, ensure you have ADB (Android Debug Bridge) installed. To check, run:\n1 adb version If it‚Äôs not installed, you can get it with:\n1 sudo pacman -S android-tools ALVR (Air Light VR) ALVR allows wireless PC VR gaming by streaming games from your PC to a standalone headset like the Meta Quest series. It uses low-latency video encoding to provide a seamless experience.\nDownload ALVR from the official ALVR GitHub releases page\nInstall the APK on your headset using SideQuest. Extract the .tar file on your Arch Linux machine and run the executable. Follow the on-screen instructions to set up ALVR. Be sure to mark the headset as \u0026ldquo;trusted.\u0026rdquo;\nOnce done, start SteamVR.\nFrom there, manually start VR games from your PC. While this is a limitation, once the game is running, you can enjoy your session in the VR headset.\nTips \u0026amp; tricks Fix for Black Screen on Headset If your VR game runs on your PC but your headset displays a black screen, try this fix: Add the following command to SteamVR\u0026rsquo;s launch options:\n~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/SteamVR/bin/vrmonitor.sh %command%\n(Note: File paths may vary depending on where you installed SteamVR.)\nFix for Games Not Launching in VR Mode Is the game not launching in VR mode? Go to the game properties, then to Compatibility, and enable Proton. After that, in General settings or during the first game launch, it will ask if you want to play in normal mode or VR mode.\nHappy gaming ! :) ","date":"2024-12-30T00:00:00Z","image":"https://saitech.blog/p/quest-3-on-arch/3_hu_974740a45ad8ac36.jpg","permalink":"https://saitech.blog/p/quest-3-on-arch/","title":"Quest 3 on Arch"},{"content":"\nWhat will you need Geiger‚ÄìM√ºller kit for example this one Raspberry pi - any model is fine but guide is written for raspberry pi 5.
