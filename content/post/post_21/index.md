Alright, straight to itâ€”I spent way too much time fighting with my Xbox controller on Linux. It said it was connected via Bluetooth, but nope, constant disconnects like a flakey Wi-Fi signal.

Turns out, the fix was simpler than expected. Huge thanks to <b>[this](https://plug-world.com/posts/fixing-xbox-bluetooth-controllers-in-arch-linux/)</b> blog post for pointing me in the right direction.



First, make sure you have the kernel headers:


```
sudo pacman -S linux-headers
```
Then, install xpadneo, which fixes a bunch of Xbox controller nonsense:

```
yay -S xpadneo-dkms-git
```

Hereâ€™s the kickerâ€”you have to update your controllerâ€™s firmware, and Microsoft, being Microsoft, only lets you do it on Windows.

So either:

*  Boot into Windows (if you have it)
*  Use a Windows VM

Reboot, reconnect, and boomâ€”your controller should finally work without dropping every five seconds.

Hope this saves someone the headache I had. Happy gaming! ðŸŽ®
